# Multiple Choice Question

```java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String color;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.make = "Mazda";
        myCar.color = "white";
        System.out.println(myCar);
    }
}
```

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

## Correct

A string containing the object's memory location that looks something like `Car@4617c264`.

> Correct! Since `Car` does not override the `toString()` method, the default
> implementation prints the memory address.

## Incorrect

Car{make='Mazda', color='white'}

> Incorrect.  `Car` does not override the `toString()` method, so the default
> implementation prints a string containing the memory address.
