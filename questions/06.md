# Java Visualizer

```java
 public class WeatherForecast {

    int low = 50;
    int high = 70;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherForecast forecast1 = new WeatherForecast();
        WeatherForecast forecast2 = new WeatherForecast();

        ??? = ???;
    }

}

```

What is the correct assignment statement (i.e. replace ???)
to produce the object state shown?  HINT: Use dot notation to access
the `high` temperature field through an object reference.
