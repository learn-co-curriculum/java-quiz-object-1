# Assigning Object State


```java
public class MathQuestion {

    String equation;
    int value;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathQuestion q1 = new MathQuestion();
        q1.equation = "2+2";
        q1.value = 4;

        MathQuestion q2 = new MathQuestion();
        q2.equation = "5*4";
        q2.value = 20;

        System.out.println(q2.equation + "=" + q2.value);
    }

}
```

What is printed when the main method executes?

## Correct

5*4=20
