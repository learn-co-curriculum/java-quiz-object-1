# Field Initializers

```java
public class Homework {

    int score = 100;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Homework h1 = new Homework();
        Homework h2 = new Homework();
        h2.score = 88;

        System.out.println("h1:" + h1.score);
        System.out.println("h2:" + h2.score);
