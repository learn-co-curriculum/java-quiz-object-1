# Multiple Choice Question

```java
public class Car {
  private String make;
  private String color;

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Car{" +
            "make='" + make + '\'' +
            ", color='" + color + '\'' +
            '}';
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car myCar = new Car();
    myCar.make = "Mazda";
    myCar.color = "white";

    Car yourCar = new Car();
    yourCar.make = "Honda";
    yourCar.color = "Blue";

    System.out.println(yourCar);
  }
}

```

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

## Correct
Car{make='Honda', color='Blue'}


## Incorrect

A string containing the object's memory location that looks something like `Car@4617c264`.

> `Car` overrides the `toString()` method, so the print statement automatically calls the `toString()` method to get
> a string representation of the object referenced by `yourCar`.

## Incorrect

Car{make='Mazda', color='white'}

> Incorrect.  The print statement automatically calls the `toString()`
> method with the object referenced by `yourCar`, not `myCar`.
